\subsection*{Group Structure}
In order to implement our application efficiently, we have decided to split the work between the team members, under Jo Schlemper’s leadership. \\
Terence worked mainly on the database, its state and maintenance, and helped with the interactions between the database and the application itself.
Thai tam worked mainly on the graphics of the application, including its scaling on multiple screens, and its user-friendliness aspects, and helped with the implementation of operations to be executed after user input.
Jo worked mainly on the interactions between the database and the application, as well as the operations resulting from user input. Being the leader of the group, he overlooked the work in general, and was key to linking the different parts of the application together.
 
\subsection*{Implementation Language}
We have chosen to develop an application for Android devices, including tablets such as the Nexus7 tablet, as they are currently very common, and used very frequently in our current society – it is easy to spot someone in public transports, playing with their phone or other device. Their democratisation has led us to thinking that creating an application with such a target would induce a large range of users, and hence a strong usage of the application, which is, as developers, a goal to reach. \\
The Java IDE platform for Android development includes many useful libraries and templates, which render making basic graphics for an android application very easy. This means that it would be possible to implement interactions between the graphic elements of the application and the database early in the design process, while still being able to ameliorate the visual aspects of the application at a later date – the time gain is considerable. Furthermore, the resources on Java based android developing are far more abundant and consistent than on any other language – this would become very helpful in manipulating code. We have therefore decided to choose Java as our implementation language.\\

\subsubsection*{Server}
We have chosen Tomcat as a server, as it is the most extensively application server used in the world, and allows easy build and check of connected applications, especially when working with Java and its associated JREs. Furthermore, it offers some kind of flexibility, as Tomcat is part of the Apache Jakarta Project - it is possible to run Apache on a server, but use Tomcat on another machine. This would be useful if we were to grow our project, or if we wanted to offer a high level of security and stability.

\subsubsection*{Database}
We have chosen to work with a PostgreSQL database as it is a very reliable and robust system. It is also compatible with a large range of platforms, including Windows and Unix, making it easy to work with and extend. Furthermore, PostgreSQL is very efficient and easy to use for operations such as adding or deleting a column. It also allows composite keys and sequences (generating a pseudo-unique id), which are very useful. Lastly, the error messages are more useful and informative than for instance MySQL.

\subsection*{Design Process}
\subsubsection*{Planning}
As members of society, we feel a need to interact with one another, sometimes leading to requests. A common request, especially amongst friends, is “Could you please lend me x pounds?”, thus leading to debts. However, tracking the amount of money your friends owe you, as well as the amount you owe them can become a very cumbersome task. In order to resolve this problem, we have decided to create a system that would allow some user to track his debts easily. \\
Our society is one of technology and innovations – phones, computers, machines are now part of our everyday lives. As such, we have decided that developing a technological application would be able to reach the most number of users, and therefore, satisfy the majority. However, each individual has different views of what to consider “ideal”. We therefore had to spend time studying and revising the content of our application: should we include a full-fledged instant messaging system? Will the users need it? Should we add this feature? How should this feature and your friends’ accounts interact? After asking ourselves these questions, we have concluded that our application would include the following features: a transaction tracking system that would include the setting of new transactions, a calendar that would allow transaction deadlines, an instant messaging system, a synchronised wish list, user profiles, as well as a settings button that would enable the user to switch between two kinds of transaction views (see Program). We then sketched on paper the main activities’ screen so everyone would have a concrete idea of what would be included in each one of the features available in our application.

\subsubsection*{Implementation and testing}
We started up by, on one hand, setting up the database with all the necessary relations (users, etc), as well as the server, and on the other hand, creating the basic graphics for the activities corresponding to the features stated above. We populated the database with dummies in order to test the correctness of our application and especially that of the login screen (Can you log in if you enter the right phone number and the right password? What happens if one of the attributes is incorrect?), and implemented the database-user input interactions. We meanwhile also ameliorated the graphics of the activity, scaling it, at first, for Nexus7 tablet screen size. We then repeated this cycle over all the relevant activities.


\subsection*{Back-ups}
We have used Git as our version control for the whole duration of our project, and set up the repository on GitHub. This has allowed us to work in parallel, easily compare different versions of our project, as well as come back to a previous one if necessary.


\section*{Program (40\% Aim for 6 pages with pictures)}
\subsection*{Description}
Our final product is an android application which keeps track of debts. Once a user registers to the database, the user can create a new transaction, view transactions and make a payment or a partial payment for the transactions. The application provides the ability to make transactions to an individual or a group. It also supports messaging for individuals or a group, which can be used as a mean to communicate with each other, urge one another to pay and so on. The view of the transactions can be customised according to the users’ preference: per person or per item. Per person displays a list of people who you owe or who owes you and total amount of the debt. Clicking on the entry allows you to view a profile page, from which you can nudge, message, call and make a new transaction to the person. It also provides a log of transactions you have with the person.

\subsection*{Design Patterns}
Although the fundamental idea of the application is fairly simple, achieving the functionalities require careful considerations of design patterns. 

\subsubsection*{Classic 3-tier architecture}
For multiple users to interact with one another, it is necessary to have a convention for the communication of data. To achieve this we decided to deploy a classic 3-tier architecture as having a database on the server simplifies this communication process. Every time when a user requests to view or create transactions, the requests will be sent to the server through HTTP methods, GET or POST. For our application, it is unnecessary to serve a page; instead, we pass around a data between the client and the server in JSON format. The reason why we chose JSON is because it is a standard format for passing data through networks. It means that there are many third party libraries for encoding and decoding JSON string. For the client side, we used the standard library from Android to decode JSON string; on the client side, we wrote a code which builds a JSON string.

\includegraphics[keepaspectratio=true,scale=0.5]{3tier}
\caption{The 3-tier Architecutre}
\label{visina8}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection*{Builder pattern}
To build a JSON string from the server side, we wrote a class \texttt{JSONBuilder.java} which lets you to build a JSON string. JSON string requires specific characters such as `$\lbrace$' `:' and writing the string manually could be erroneous so using the builder not only lets you make use of the pattern, it also simplifies the code and yet relatively easier to read. 

\begin{verbatim}
In JSONBuilder.java:
//... execute SQL query and obtain a set of results in transactionSet
// Build JSON string
JSONBuilder jb = new JSONBuilder();
jb.beginObject().append("returnCode",1).beginArray();
while (transactionSet.next()) {
//...Obtain the result
						
jb.beginObject().append("transid", transId)
                .append("name",transName)
                .append("total_amount",transAmount)
  .endObject();
}
jb.endArray().endObject();			
writer.println(jb.build());
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection*{Singleton Pattern}

According to \texttt{apache.org}, it is recommended to have a single instance of a HttpClient per application. This is because instantiating a HttpClient is costly in resources. In our code, we decided to only instantiate a single instance of a HttpClient as we make a use of the client frequently. We wouldn't want the client to take up all the resources. In \texttt{CustomHttpClient.java}, one can see that we have a static \texttt{getHttpClient()} method to get the single instance of it. The \texttt{getHttpClient()} is declared private because it will only be used in the static GET and POST methods defined in the class. All the other classes will use the methods defined here. 

\begin{verbatim}
In CustomHttpClient.java:
private static HttpClient getHttpClient() { //.... }

public static InputStream executeHttpPost(String url, 
List<NameValuePair> postParameters) throws Exception {
            HttpClient client = getHttpClient();
            //... make a request
}  
\end{verbatim} 

\subsubsection*{Concurrency}

Our program uses frequent network operations. However, these network operations could suffer from unpredictable delays; hence, we do not know when exactly the data arrives from the server. A thread executing the network operation needs to be blocked while waiting for the response from the server. In terms of the user experience, this is problematic because if the main thread executes the network operations, it could block itself until the response arrives. For android, the main thread is also responsible for generating user interaces and the views. Which implies that user will see your program freezing in every so often whenever the program performs network operations. In order to avoid this, we make a heavy use of \texttt{AsyncTask} class. \texttt{AsyncTask} is an abstract class defined by Android and can be used to perform background operations on another thread, which in our case is the network operations. By using this class user will not need to see the program freezing; instead, the view will be updated as the data arrives.     
  \begin{verbatim}
In MainActivity.java:
public void loginHandler(View view) {
    ...obtain data from user input

    // Ensure the network connection
    ConnectivityManager connMgr = (ConnectivityManager) 
    getSystemService(Context.CONNECTIVITY_SERVICE);
    if (ConnectionHelper.checkNetworkConnection(connMgr))
    //Create a new asynchronous task to verify the password from the server
        new PasswordVerifier().execute(phoneNo, password);
    else
        errorView.setText("No network connection");
}

private class PasswordVerifier extends AsyncTask<String,Void,Boolean>{
...
}
 \end{verbatim}
 
\subsubsection*{Observer Pattern}

All the GUI components for android follows the observer pattern. All the GUI components are subscribed for an event. When a user interacts (e.g. click) with the component an event will be created. The components by default does nothing but we can specify the behaviour by overriding the methods such as "onClickListener", or calling them from the XML using "android:onClick". For example, on our "transaction" window, the user can see a list of people who he or she owes to know how much one owes to different people.  

\begin{center}
\begin{verbatim}
In PerPeron.java:
	transList = (ListView) findViewById(R.id.PerPersonList);
	transList.setOnItemClickListener(new OnItemClickListener() {
		@Override
		public void onItemClick(AdapterView<?> a, View v, int pos, long id) {
			...
		}
\end{verbatim}
\end{center}
\subsubsection*{Template Method}
Our program uses adapters in order to display the different transactions in two ways: per item and per person. However, these two modes essentially encapture the same behaviour: they display the amount that the user owes or is owed on the screen, and allows them to look into the details of each transaction. As such, we have implemented a template: 
\begin{verbatim}
public abstract class CustomAdapter<T> 
\end{verbatim}.
This class is extended by the PerPersonAdapter and the PerItemAdapter.

\subsubsection*{General Style}
In general, we tried to follow the basic design principle as much as possible, such as SOLID. Each classes has a single responsibility to one activity. Common methods such as Http methods are extracted out in a specific class. The project is Open to adding new features as this would only require adding new classes representing new activity or a process. In our project, we have a class which represents the data of transaction: \texttt{TransactionDetail.java}. We have considered encapsulation the fields in the class. We were required to pass data in \texttt{TransactionDetail} to different classes; for this, we used \texttt{Intent}, which is a class defined by Android. When passing data betweeen different activities, one can put data into Intent on one side, retrieve data from Intent on the other side. This strategy respects the Law of demeter; we do not need to know anything about the neighbours but simply know the "key" to retrieve the data we need. In this way we have achieved both good encapsulation and low coupling between different classes.

Android SDK? Not sure if needed to mention here though.
CustomHttpClient.java from Android Developers: http://developerrohit.blogspot.co.uk/2011/04/customhttpclientjava.html
Took as an inspiration for our client side HTTP methods such as GET and POST.
We created our own logo and icons so we should not have any problem for copyright. 

\subsection*{Copyright}
The images and icons we have used have all been created by our group, and therefore, we should not have any third-party copyright issue in those regards.
Some of our code used template code provided by Android Developers when downloading the Android SDK. As such, it is not subject to copyright issues. Furthermore, little "skill and labour" were used in the process of using these templates, and their usage is therefore not liable for pursuit.\\
However, if we were to commercialise the app, we would need to license all our work, including our database set up, in order for third parties not to steal our work. We would also need to get database rights in order to form a database of all users and their relevant informations, such as phone numbers, friend lists, etc. \\
Unless we wanted to let our application be open sourced, we would also need to remove, or hide our Git repository on GitHub. Otherwise, we would need to license our product with an open source license.
