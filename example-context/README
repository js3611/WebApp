Personal Tomcat Notes
=====================

1. Directory Layout:

This personal tomcat directory is laid out as follows:

conf:	vital Tomcat config files, especially:

	server.xml	   (defining the port - 59999 - Tomcat binds to),
	web.xml	           (defining what servlets are initially configured),
	context.xml	   (defining that contexts are reloadable),
	logging.properties (defining how logs are processed).

logs:	where the Tomcat logs are stored, especially:

	catalina.DATE.log   the Tomcat startup messages.
	access.DATE.log	    web accesses made so far.
	localhost.DATE.log  miscellaneous other messages.

	The logs are cleared out each time you run 'tomcat6 start'

src:	a suggested directory for all your Java servlet/bean classes,
	plus installation logic (ant/make/whatever) to deploy them into
	the webapp context directory:

webapps/ROOT:
	where Personal Tomcat's sole webapp resides.  Under this directory
	we have the usual context directory structure:
		*.html			- static web pages scattered about
		*.jsp			- JSP pages scattered about
		WEB-INF/web.xml		- servlet namespace mappings.
		WEB-INF/classes/*.class	- servlet/bean/support class files
		WEB-INF/lib/*.jar	- servlet/bean/support jars

	We've prepped this directory with index.jsp, a trivial example.

work:	where Tomcat places it's working files, eg. the Java servlet source
	files generated from JSP files are stored here.  In particular,
	index.jsp will be turned into a servlet stored in:
	  work/Catalina/localhost/_/org/apache/jsp/index_jsp.java
	and then compiled into:
	  work/Catalina/localhost/_/org/apache/jsp/index_jsp.class

2. Starting Personal Tomcat on a Lab PC.

- Logged on to an arbitrary lab PC, having created a context directory
  using mktomcat6, cd into that context directory.

- Choose what TCP port (above 1024) you'd like Tomcat to start on, we
  suggest 59999 as an arbitrary unused port - specify the port by
  changing two lines in conf/server.xml (changing "59999" to your chosen port):

  <!-- Define a non-SSL HTTP/1.1 Connector on port 59999 -->
  <Connector port="59999" maxHttpHeaderSize="8192"

- Now, start Tomcat running:  tomcat6 start

- Check the logs.  In particular, check the catalina.DATE.log file to
  see whether or not Tomcat started successfully.

- If so, start a web browser on your lab PC, and point it at the URL:

    http://localhost:59999/

  (or whichever port you choose).

- index.jsp should execute and you should see the results.

- and don't forget to stop Tomcat: tomcat6 stop
